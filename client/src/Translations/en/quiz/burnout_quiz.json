Your energy reserves are solid, work feels meaningful, and you're genuinely excited about Monday morning (yes, really). You probably have a color-coded calendar and actually take your lunch breaks.",
                "advice": "Keep those boundaries sacred. Whatever you're doing—the early gym sessions, the hard no to Sunday emails, the actual vacation time—don't let anyone guilt you into stopping.",

                "advice": "This is the sweet spot, but it's also where people get complacent. Schedule that PTO now before Q4 gets crazy. Build in buffer time between big projects.",

You reply 'sounds good' to messages you didn't fully read. Your coffee consumption has doubled but effectiveness has halved.",
                "advice": "Yellow alert territory. Time to have that conversation with your manager about workload. Take that mental health day you've been postponing. Delete at least three things from your to-do list.",

                "advice": "This is serious. Take time off—real time off. Talk to HR, your manager, or a professional about burnout. Something has to change: workload, role, boundaries, or environment.",

                "advice": "STOP. This is not sustainable. Take medical leave if you can. See a therapist or doctor—burnout has real health consequences. Your worth is not your productivity. Consider whether this role/company/career is actively harming you.",
