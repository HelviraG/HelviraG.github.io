We navigate our unique world, driven by an unwavering coding passion.\n\nOnce voiceless, some of us have emerged as tech luminaries, vital to the industry's progress. Major tech firms now recognize the Autistics significance.\n\nThen, what connects us to Tech History? Why do exploring code lines appeal more to us than living human experiences?\n\nDuring this talk, we will explore the untold Autistic narrative in tech and envision a harmonious future where both autistic and tech worlds unite.\n\nThis is our unsung history, waiting to be heard.",

And easily, upon this developer's contact, unease can arise if we do not feel this passion.\nAnd this, even if you are a developer yourself.\n\nThis discomfort can be a source of worry and doubt about one's skills.\n\nIndeed, if the enthusiast devotes hours to personal projects, perhaps we should?\n\nBut then, do you have to be passionate to be a developer?\nDoes passion truly add value?\n\nWouldn't the injunction to passion in dev ultimately be a trap?\n\nIs passion THE essential software for anyone wishing to code?\n\nHere, is the whole purpose of this conference!\n\nBonus: If you like Vikings, this is for you !",

And why does every developer have an irrational hatred for at least one programming language?\n\nThis talk dives into the hidden psychology of software development, revealing how cognitive biases, fear of failure, and pure developer stubbornness influence our choices more than we’d like to admit.\n\nFrom the Sunk Cost Fallacy (aka “I spent two weeks on this refactor, so we have to use it”) to Loss Aversion (aka “I know this function is useless, but what if we need it someday?”), we’ll explore the surprisingly human side of coding.\n\nExpect real-world examples, and hard-hitting truths about why we write, delete, and rewrite code the way we do.\n\nBy the end, you’ll walk away with maybe, just maybe, the courage to delete that ancient, commented-out function from 2017, finally!"

We’ll test the “Silence vs. Soundtrack” debate, explore neuroscience-backed findings, and try a few live audio experiments.\n\nExpect humor, relatable dev stories, and playlists you’ll want to steal.\n\nAttendees will leave with:\n- Genre-based “coding mode” music formulas\n- Science-backed strategies to use music for debugging, flow, or ideation\n- A new soundtrack for their next coding session\n\n🚀 Warning: spontaneous playlist sharing may occur."

            "content": "Backend engineers often undervalue frontend development, viewing it as less technical or secondary to “real engineering.”\n\nIn leaner teams or during resource constraints, backend developers must contribute to the UI. Without the right foundations, this results in fragile code, inconsistent user experiences, and increased support costs — ultimately impacting business performance.\n\nThe misconception is widespread, yet the reality is clear: frontend engineering follows structured, logical principles as systematic as those of chemistry.\n\nBy understanding this “scientific layer” of frontend, backend engineers can build stable interfaces, collaborate more effectively across the stack, and safeguard product quality even under organizational pressure.\n\nThis session reveals the underlying mechanics of UI behavior, reactivity, and styling systems. We’ll explore how data flows trigger predictable UI outcomes, how the CSS cascade influences application stability, and how to maintain clarity in complex component architectures.\n\nYou will gain:\n- Patterns for building maintainable React interfaces\n- Scalable CSS strategies that minimize regressions\n- Practical debugging methods aligned with backend problem-solving\n\nIdeal for backend engineers seeking confidence, versatility, and impact across the full stack."
